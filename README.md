## Running the application
- Open up a terminal and run `npm i` in the **root**, **client** and **server** directories.
- After that's done, run `npm run dev` in the root directory.
- Wait for the app to finish loading and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (default) on your browser.
- You should see the server logging `Saved a client with UUID: <uuid>` on your terminal, which means
  the client app successfully connected to the server.
- You should also see a login screen on your browser. Go ahead and open as many instances of the app as you like,
  enter your nicknames and start chatting!
